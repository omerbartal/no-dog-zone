# New project notice
This is a very new project. If people are interested it will grow. I've never managed an open source project so any help would be great, even managing contributions and building procedures would be helpful.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you're interested.

# Todo list:
There are lots of improvements which can be done to the project if anyone wants to contribute:
- Document the project
- Build a real package and installer
- Write an app to calibrate the tool and to get notifications from it
- Integrate other and better models
- Detect more complicated stuff
- More actions
- Support for speakers playing audio (initial support exists)
- Support for more inputs (like the Raspberry Pi camera, a windows camera, etc)
- A printable box with wall mount
