# Hi
This is a very new project. I've never managed an open source project so any help would be great, even managing contributions and building procedures would be helpful.

Please feel free to [contact me directly](https://twitter.com/omer_bartal) if you're interested. That's the best way to show interest in the project :)

The nice thing about this project is that it can turn into anything which meets the definition:

detect something using a pretrained model --> do something with hardware

# Todo list:
There are lots of improvements which can be done to the project if anyone wants to contribute:
- Document the project
- Build a real package and installer
- Write an app to calibrate the tool and to get notifications from it
- Integrate other and better models
- Detect more types of pets
- Detect complicated stuff (like "dog sitting on couch" and not just a dog)
- More actions
- Support for speakers playing audio (initial support exists)
- Support for more inputs (like the Raspberry Pi camera, a windows camera, etc)
- A printable box with wall mount
